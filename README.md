We implement a MATLAB animated visualisation of the generalised Collatz system:

For each even iteration k in C^k(n), when C^k(n) does not equal 1, from n up to t, the x-coordinate of a point increases by lcos(theta) and for each odd iteration delta(x)=-lcos(theta). The source code is found in main.m.
